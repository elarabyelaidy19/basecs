# Indexing and B+ Trees  


# Indexing
- looking up things by values.
> â€œIf you don't find it in the index, look very carefully through the entire catalog. 
- Indexing Data Structure 
    - Search Trees(AVL, B+ Tree, Red Black Tree, 2-3 Tree) 
    - Hash Table 

## Index 
- index is a data structure that enables quick **lookup(equality)** and **modification(insert, delete)** of **data entries(items stored in index)** by search **key(subset of columns)**.   
- **Types** B+ trees, B- trees, Hash Tables, GIST, allow lookups without scanning all data.


## Indexing 
- index is a data structure that allows you speed up reads on a speicific key. it's make queries run faster especially those that are run frequently. 
- index on the user id is a good example of an index. 


## B+ Trees 
- B+ tree have very high **Fan-out**: number of pointers to child nodes in a node. 
- B+ tree is a **self-balancing** tree, grows at root not leaves.
- strores data entries in **leaf nodes** only, thus called B Plus Tree. 
- **Order** is the number of children nodes for internal nodes. it's measure capacity of a nodes.  
- the number of entries for each internal node must satisfy **d < entries < 2d**.  
- Max fan-out is **2d + 1** == num of pointers.  
- Only the leaf nodes contain records (or pointers to records).  Theinner nodes (which are the non-leaf nodes) do not contain the actual records.

## Scalling B+ Trees 
- B+ tree allow index Massive number of records.

### Searching B+ Trees
- start at root, do a binary search on the key, find the record in the leafs.
 

## inseting B+ Trees 
- find the correct Leaf.
- put data entry int the leaf. 
    - if leaf have enough space, insert, done!. 
    - else split the leaf into two leafs. (L1, L2)  
        - redistribute the entries evenly, **copy up** middle key and ptr to L2. 
        -  insert index entry pointing to L2 into L.  
            - else recursively split and **push up** from parents.

## Deleting B+ Trees 
- occupency invariants not inforced during deletion. 
- just delete leaf entries and save space for next insertion.  
-  if leaf is completely empty, taht's ok 


## B+ Tree Bulk Loading 
- Build index on Large table from scratch. it will take a long time, search from root and insert leaving half empty Leaves. modify random pages. 
- **Smarter Way** Sort input records by key, fill leaf page by fill factor 3/4. 
-  when parent is full split.

# Summary

- B+ Tree is a powerful dynamic indexing structure
- Inserts/deletes leave tree height-balanced; logFN cost
- High fanout (F) means height rarely more than 3 or 4.
- Higher levels stay in cache, avoiding expensive disk I/O
- Almost always better than maintaining a sorted file.
- Widely used in DBMSs!
- Bulk loading can be much faster than repeated inserts for creating a B+ tree on a large
data set.
