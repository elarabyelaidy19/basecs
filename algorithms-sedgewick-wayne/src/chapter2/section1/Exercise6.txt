2.1.6

Insertion sort because it will only make one comparison with the previous element (per element) and won't exchange any elements,
running in linear time. Selection sort will exchange each element with itself and will run in quadratic time.

Thanks to glucu (https://github.com/glucu) for correcting the number of exchanges done in selection sort.
