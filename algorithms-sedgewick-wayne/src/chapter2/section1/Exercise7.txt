2.1.7

Selection sort because even though both selection sort and insertion sort will run in quadratic time, selection sort will
only make N exchanges, while insertion sort will make N * N / 2 exchanges.

Thanks to LudekCizinsky (https://github.com/LudekCizinsky), rg9a27 (https://github.com/rg9a27) and
BOTbkcd (https://github.com/BOTbkcd) for correcting the number of exchanges in selection sort.
