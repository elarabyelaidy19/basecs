2.1.23 - Deck sort

They separate all cards by suit, making the swaps in order to keep cards in the same suit next to each other (dividing the row in 4 areas).
Then, in each suit, they sort the cards by rank using selection sort.
In the second step (once suits are sorted), some of them move the unsorted smaller ranks near to the front while searching for the next smallest rank.
