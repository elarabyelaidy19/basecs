2.5.23 - Sampling for selection

Sampling improves selection in cases where the element searched is one of the smallest or highest values in the array.
For example, when searching for the 2nd smallest element in an array of size 10^9, selecting one of the smallest elements as the pivot in the initial steps will yield better performance than always choosing the median. 
This can discard 75%+ of the array, improving selection performance.
