Yes. The merge phase uses two pointers that move comparing both subarray values.
Once it finds that one value is smaller than the other, it selects this value for the output without checking the other elements.
If one or more of the input subarrays are not sorted then some values would be considered in the wrong position during this comparison, leading to an incorrect output.
