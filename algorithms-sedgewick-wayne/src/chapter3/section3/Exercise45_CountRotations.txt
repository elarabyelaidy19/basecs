3.3.45 - Count rotations

When the tree doesn't have many nodes (less than 2000) the average number of rotations and splits is around 2 per put() operation.
When the tree has more than 2000 nodes the average number of rotations and splits is 1 per put() operation, possibly because the tree already has many balanced branches and the rotations and splits do not propagate up many levels.
During the experiment the worst-case number of rotations and splits was close to 20.
