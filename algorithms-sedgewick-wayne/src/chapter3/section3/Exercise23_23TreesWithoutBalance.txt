3.3.23 - 2-3 trees without balance restriction

Average path length for 100 random insertions: 7
Average path length for 1000 random insertions: 12
Average path length for 10000 random insertions: 17
Average path length for 100000 random insertions: 20
Average path length for 1000000 random insertions: 26
Average path length for 10000000 random insertions: 30

Hypothesis: In a non-balanced 2-3 tree the average path length becomes the same as the average path length for a standard binary search tree: ~1.44 lg N after N random insertions.
