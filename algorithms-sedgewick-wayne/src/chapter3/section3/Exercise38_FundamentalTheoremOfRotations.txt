3.3.38 - Fundamental theorem of rotations

Any BST can be transformed into any other BST on the same set of keys by a sequence of left and right rotations.

Rotations move keys to the left or right, allowing BSTs to change their structure. 
After repeatedly doing left rotations on the largest key and recurring on the resulting left subtree, the resulting BST has height N (with every right link null). On the other hand, after repeatedly doing right rotations on the smallest key and recurring on the resulting right subtree, the resulting BST has height N (with every left link null).
These are the left and right limits, and BSTs can move between these structures with rotations on different nodes.

Example:
