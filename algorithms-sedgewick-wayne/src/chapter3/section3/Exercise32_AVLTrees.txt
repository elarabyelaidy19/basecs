3.3.32 - AVL trees

Coloring red links that go from nodes of even height to nodes of odd height in an AVL tree gives a perfectly balanced 2-3-4 tree.
This happens because every two levels of the tree will merge its nodes into 4-nodes (or 3-nodes if the node has only one child or 2-nodes if the node has no children). This generates a perfectly balanced 2-3-4 tree.

For an AVL tree of size 6:

         (B)H
   (B)B        (B)V
(B)A  (B)C   (B)R

2-3 representation
    H
  B   V
 A C R

After coloring red links:

         (B)H
   (R)B        (R)V
(B)A  (B)C   (B)R

2-3 representation
    BHV
  A C   R

For an AVL tree of size 19:
                                  (B)P
                    (B)L                        (B)T
        (B)H              (B)N           (B)R          (B)V
   (B)F        (B)J    (B)M  (B)O     (B)Q   (B)S   (B)U  (B)X
(B)E  (B)G  (B)I  (B)K

2-3 representation
              P
        L           T
    H       N     R    V
 F    J   M   O  Q S  U X
E G  I K

After coloring red links:

                    (R)L                        (R)T
        (B)H              (B)N           (B)R          (B)V
   (R)F        (R)J    (R)M  (R)O     (R)Q   (R)S   (R)U  (R)X
(B)E  (B)G  (B)I  (B)K
