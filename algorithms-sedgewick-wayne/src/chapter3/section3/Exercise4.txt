3.3.4

Proposition: The height of a 2-3 tree with N keys is between ~log3 N ~ .63 lg N (for a tree that is all 3-nodes) and ~lg N (for a tree that is all 2 nodes).

Proof: The height of a tree is equal to the maximum number of compares between the root and a leaf node.
When a 2-3 tree has all its nodes as 3-nodes, the maximum number of compares between the root and a leaf node will be ~log3 N because after each compare only 1/3 of the remaining nodes are considered for further comparisons.
When a 2-3 tree has all its nodes as 2-nodes, the maximum number of compares between the root and a leaf node will be ~lg N because after each compare only 1/2 of the remaining nodes are considered for further comparisons.
So the height of a 2-3 tree with N keys will be between ~log3 N and ~lg N.
