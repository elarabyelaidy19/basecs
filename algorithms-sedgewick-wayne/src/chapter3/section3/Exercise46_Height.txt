3.3.46 - Height

The average height of the red-black BST after all the put() operations is 15.
The final red-black BST size is 8932 and since the height was measured from N = 1 to N = 8932 , the average height is consistent with the formula: 
AVG Height ~ 2 lg n
It is also interesting to notice that the height may decrease after insertions of nodes.
