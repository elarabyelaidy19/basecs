The probability can be computed using hypergeometric distribution. The distribution describes the probability of k successes in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N that contains exactly K successes, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. The probability is equal to

P(k successes) = (K) (N - K)
                 (k) (n - k)
                 ___________
                    (N)
                    (n)

The k successes in this case are all the indices divisible by 100 being occupied. In a hash table of size 10^6 there are 10^4 indices divisible by 100, so k = 10^4.
The total successes K is also 10^4, which are all possible indices divisible by 100.
The population size N is the hash table size, 10^6.
The n draws are the put() operations that were made on the hash table, 10^6 / 2 = 500.000.
The probability is then:

P(all indices divisible by 100 occupied) = (10000) (10^6  -  10000)
                                           (10000) (500000 - 10000)
                                           ________________________
                                                  ( 10^6 )
                                                  (500000)
