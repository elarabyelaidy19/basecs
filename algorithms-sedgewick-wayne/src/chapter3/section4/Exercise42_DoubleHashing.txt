3.4.42 - Double hashing

In experiments inserting 10^6 keys, querying 5x10^5 keys and deleting 5x10^5 keys, linear-probing had better performance than double hashing on all operations (put, get and delete).

Operation |  Linear-probing HT time |  Double hashing HT time
      Put                      0.21                      4.68
      Get                      0.05                      2.43
   Delete                      0.12                      1.05
