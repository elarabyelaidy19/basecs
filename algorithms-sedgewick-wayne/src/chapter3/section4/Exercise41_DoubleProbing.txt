3.4.41 - Double probing

In experiments inserting 10^6 keys, querying 5x10^5 keys and deleting 5x10^5 keys, separate-chaining had better performance than double probing on all operations (put, get and delete).

Operation |  Separate-chaining HT time |  Double probing HT time
      Put                         1.93                      2.51
      Get                         0.11                      0.22
   Delete                         0.16                      0.28
