Given R = 256 and M = 255, we shall prove that the hash of all strings with the same collection of chars is the same.
In fact, we can prove the proposition that hash(string) = (sum of chars) % 255 for all strings by induction on string
length.

For any string with only one char, the proposition holds trivially.
Let hash(str{k}) denote the hash of a string no longer than k, char(k) is the k-th char.
By induction assumption, we have:
hash(str{k}) = (sum of k chars) % 255

Then we have:
hash(str{k + 1}) = (hash(str{k}) * 256 + char(k + 1)) % 255
 = (hash(str{k}) * (255 + 1) + char(k + 1)) % 255
 = (hash(str{k}) * 255 + hash(str{k}) + char(k + 1)) % 255
 = (hash(str{k}) + char(k + 1)) % 255
 = ((sum of k chars) % 255 + char(k + 1)) % 255
 = ((sum of k chars + char(k + 1)) % 255) % 255
 = (sum of k + 1 chars) % 255
Note that (N * 255) % 255 = 0, and the char values are always less than 255, so the chars can be moved into the modular
expression.

Hence, by induction, the proposition holds for strings of any length.
All strings with the same collection of chars must have the same sum of chars, so by the proposition they must have the
same hash.
