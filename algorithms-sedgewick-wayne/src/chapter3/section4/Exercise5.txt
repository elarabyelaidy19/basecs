The implementation is legal since objects that are equal() will have the same hash code.
However, using it will be very ineffective since all keys will have the same hash code and will be placed on the same bucket/index in a hash table. This means that there will always be hash collisions and that the hash table will have the same characteristics of a linked list, with linear time for get(), put() and delete() operations.
