3.1.37 - Put/get ratio

For a symbol table with 10-bit int values the amount of time that BinarySearchST spent on put() was lower than the amount of time it spent on get().
However, for all the other scenarios (counting the frequency of 20 and 30-bit values and the frequency of the words in the book Tale of Two Cities) the amount of time that BinarySearchST spends on put() operations is much higher than the amount of time it spends on get().
