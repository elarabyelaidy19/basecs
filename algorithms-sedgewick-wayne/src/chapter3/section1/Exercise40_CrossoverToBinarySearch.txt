3.1.40 - Crossover to binary search

Analysis:
Considering that sequential search has a complexity of O(n) and binary search has a complexity of O(lg (n)):

N = 58: While sequential search does 58 operations (in the worst case), binary search does ~5.8 operations (in the worst case).
Binary search is ~10 times faster than sequential search for N = 58.

N = 996: While sequential search does 996 operations (in the worst case), binary search does ~9.96 operations (in the worst case).
Binary search is ~100 times faster than sequential search for N = 996.

N = 13746: While sequential search does 13,746 operations (in the worst case), binary search does ~13.746 operations (in the worst case).
Binary search is ~1000 times faster than sequential search for N = 13,746.

Experimental results:

Value of N for which binary search becomes 10 times faster than sequential search: 120
Value of N for which binary search becomes 100 times faster than sequential search: 1463
Value of N for which binary search becomes 1000 times faster than sequential search: 22461
