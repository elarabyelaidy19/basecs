3.1.36 - Performance validation II

The performance of BinarySearchST and SequentialSearchST for FrequencyCounter is even better than predicted by analysis because of the details of the FrequencyCounter application. 
FrequencyCounter does not add all the words in the symbol table (only the words with a length higher than a specified minLength parameter). Also, there are many repeated words in the Tale of Two Cities book, which was used as benchmark. Out of 135,938 words, only 561 are distinct. 
With more search hits than search misses, a sequential search does not have to check all the N words in the symbol table (its worst case) as often. The same applies to a binary search, that does not have to do lg N compares as often than if there were many search misses.
These details of the application make the performance of the symbol tables better than predicted.
