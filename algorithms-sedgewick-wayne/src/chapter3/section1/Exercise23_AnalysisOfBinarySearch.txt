3.1.23 - Analysis of binary search

As the book and exercise 3.1.20 have proven, the maximum number of compares used for a binary search in a table of size N is lg N + 1.

A number N has exactly lg N + 1 bits. This is because shifting 1 bit to the right reduces the number by half (rounded down).

For example:

N   Bit representation   Number of bits   lg N + 1
1                    1                1          1
2                   10                2          2
4                  100                3          3
5                  101                3          3
9                 1001                4          4

Therefore, the maximum number of compares used for a binary search in a table of size N is precisely the number of bits in the binary representation of N.
