The linear-probing hash symbol table had the best result and the red-black BST and the separate chaining symbol table came tied in second place with similar results.
The expected results would be both the separate chaining and linear probing hash tables achieving the best results, since they have a constant time lookup, and the red-black BST achieving a worse result (but still fast) since it has a performance of O(lg n) for search. 
Overall the results are similar to the expected, except for the time spent with the separate chaining hash table, which took longer than expected and had a similar performance as the red-black BST.
