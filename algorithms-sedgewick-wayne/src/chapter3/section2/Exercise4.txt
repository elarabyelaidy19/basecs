3.2.4

The sequence that cannot be the sequence of keys examined is:
d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5

Note: on older versions of the book, where sequence b is equal to [4, 10, 8, 7, 5, 3], it also cannot be the sequence of keys examined:
b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 5, 3

Thanks to CharlieLei (https://github.com/CharlieLei) for noting that sequence b is also part of the answer on older versions of the book.
Thanks to oddhus (https://github.com/oddhus) for noting that sequence b is not part of the answer on newer versions of the book.
