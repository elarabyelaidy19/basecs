Proposition: The running time of the two-argument keys() in a BST is at most proportional to the tree height plus the number of keys in the range.

Proof: The two-argument keys() method in a BST works in the following way:
1- It searches the tree until it finds the element which is equal or higher than the lower bound.
2- It adds the element to the queue and also adds all its right children that are inside the search range.
3- It adds all the other elements which are inside the search range by doing an in-order search in the tree (but cutting branches once it finds elements outside the range).

Step 1, searching the element which is equal or higher than the lower bound is a regular search in a BST and takes O(lg N) time, which is equal, in the worst case, to the tree height. Steps 2 and 3 combined take R operations, where R is the number of elements in the range searched. There may be a constant number of other compares, which are the cases where the method finds an element outside the range and stops the search on the current branch of the tree.
Combining all the steps the two-argument keys() in a BST is at most proportional to the tree height plus the number of keys in the range.
