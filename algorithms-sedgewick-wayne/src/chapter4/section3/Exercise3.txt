4.3.3

If a graph's edges all have distinct weights there is only one way to arrange the smallest V - 1 edge weights in increasing order when constructing the minimum spanning tree (either with Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm). Therefore, the MST is unique.

Solution 2 (based on https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/):
For the sake of contradiction, suppose there are two different MSTs of G, say T1 and T2. Let e = v-w be the min weight edge of G that is in one of T1 or T2, but not both. Let's suppose e is in T1. Adding e to T2 creates a cycle C. There is at least one edge, say f, in C that is not in T1 (otherwise T1 would be cyclic). By our choice of e, w(e) <= w(f). Since all of the edge weights are distinct, w(e) < w(f). Now, replacing f with e in T2 yields a new spanning tree with weight less than that of T2 (contradicting the minimality of T2).
