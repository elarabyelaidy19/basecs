4.3.13

The strategy "start with any vertex as a single-vertex MST, then add V - 1 edges to it, taking next a min-weight edge incident to the vertex most recently added to the MST" does not find the MST in the following graph:

  C
 / \ 
A - B - D
 \ /   /
  E - -

Where the weights of the edges are:
A-B = 1
A-C = 4
C-B = 4
B-D = 3
B-E = 1
E-A = 2
D-E = 3

The MST generated would be: 
A-B B-E E-A A-C C-B

Which is not a MST.
