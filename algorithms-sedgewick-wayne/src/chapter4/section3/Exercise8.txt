4.3.8

Given any cycle in an edge-weighted graph (all edge weights distinct), the edge of maximum weight in the cycle does not belong to the MST of the graph.

Proof:
Consider by contradiction that the edge of maximum weight in the cycle C, edge e, belongs to the MST of the graph.
Since MSTs do not contain cycles there is at least one edge in C that is not in the MST. Let's call one of these edges f.
Now add f to the MST. There is now a cycle in the MST. Since e has the maximum weight in the cycle C and all edge weights are distinct, it means that weight(f) < weight(e). Removing the edge e after having added the edge f would generate a new MST' with total weight less than the total weight in MST, contradicting its minimality.
