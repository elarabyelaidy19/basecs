At any point during the execution of Kruskal's algorithm, each vertex is closer to some vertex in its subtree than to any vertex not in its subtree.

True. Since Kruskal's algorithm adds edges to an MST by order of weight/length, if there is an edge e = v-w of length 1 and there is an edge f = v-z of length 2, there are two possible cases:

Case 1: Edge e is chosen before edge f.
In this case, vertex v is closer to a vertex in its subtree (vertex w) than to a vertex not in its subtree (vertex z).

Case 2: Edge f is chosen before edge e.
This can only happen if choosing edge e would generate a cycle. But in order to generate a cycle there must be another vertex connected to both vertex v and vertex w. Let's call this vertex a. If vertex a is already connected to vertex v this means that the length of the edge connecting v-a is smaller than the length of edge e. Therefore, even in this case vertex v is closer to a vertex in its subtree (vertex a) than to a vertex not in its subtree (both vertices w and z).
