The experiment results show that for random edge weighted graphs with uniform weight distribution the average heaviest edge weight in the minimum-spanning tree is 0.9996, and on average 299859.7 edges are not heavier than this edge weight. Since a sparse graph model was used (with 100000 vertices and 300000 edges), it is expected that the heaviest edge weight in the minimum-spanning tree will have a value close to the upper range of weight values and that most of the edges in the graph will have a weight less than or equal to it.
For random edge weighted graphs with gaussian weight distribution the average heaviest edge weight in the minimum-spanning tree is 3.3943, and on average 299841.7 edges are not heavier than this edge weight. The experiments for this graph model also used a sparse graph configuration (100000 vertices and 300000 edges) so it also makes sense that the heaviest edge weight in the minimum-spanning tree has a value close to the upper range of weight values and that most of the edges in the graph have a weight less than or equal to it.
For random edge weighted Euclidean graphs the average heaviest edge weight in the minimum-spanning tree is 0.0581, and on average 5205.1 edges are not heavier than this edge weight. 
The Euclidean graph configuration used on the experiments is of a dense graph (with 1000 vertices and 499500 edges). With more options of edges to select for the minimum-spanning tree, the heaviest edge weight is closer to the lower range of weight values. Also related to the large number of edge choices for the minimum-spanning tree, only a small fraction of the edges in the graph have less or equal weights than it.
