4.4.43 - Negative cycle detection

Initializing all distTo[] entries to 0 and adding all vertices to the queue in the new constructor will make relaxations happen only when a negative edge is found. When a negative edge is found and an edge relaxation happens, the edge will be added to edgeTo[], which will be able to reconstruct any negative cycles found and will be checked in hasNegativeCycle() and negativeCycle() method calls.
Therefore, a client call to hasNegativeCycle() will return true if and only if the graph has a negative cycle and if any such cycle exists, it will be returned in any client call to the negativeCycle() method.

Another way to show that negative cycles can be found with the new constructor is the following:
Consider a digraph formed from the original by adding a new source with an edge of weight 0 to all the other vertices. After one pass, all distTo[] entries are 0, and finding a negative cycle reachable from that source is the same as finding a negative cycle anywhere in the original graph.
