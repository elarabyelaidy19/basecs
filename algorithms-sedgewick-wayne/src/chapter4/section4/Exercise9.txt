4.4.9

The error is in the length of the shortest path between Norwich and New London. It cannot be less than 83, otherwise it would generate a path between Norwich and Westerly of length less than 101 (Norwich -> New London -> Westerly) and 101 is the length of the shortest path between Norwich and Westerly.
