For all digraph models analyzed (random digraphs with uniform weight distribution, random Euclidean digraphs and random grid digraphs) the performance of the eager version of Dijkstra's algorithm was better than the performance of the lazy version.
This is expected, since the worst case runtime of the eager version of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(E lg V) while the worst case runtime of the lazy version of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(E lg E).
