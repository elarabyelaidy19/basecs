4.1.14

If we use a stack instead of a queue when running breadth-first search, it may not compute shortest paths.
This can be seen in the following graph:

  0 (source)
 / \
1 - 2
|   |
4 - 3

If the edge 0 - 2 is inserted before the edge 0 - 1:
Using a stack, the distance from 0 to 4 will be 3.
Using a queue, the distance from 0 to 4 will be 2.

If the edge 0 - 1 is inserted before the edge 0 - 2:
Using a stack, the distance from 0 to 3 will be 3.
Using a queue, the distance from 0 to 3 will be 2.
