Eccentricity, diameter, radius, center and girth:

The strategy for computing the eccentricity, diameter, radius, center and girth of the largest component was the following:
The algorithm required for these exact computations has complexity of O(V * E) (running breadth-first search from all vertices). V is ~= 10^5, which means the algorithm required for these exact computation has complexity ~= 10^10.

In order to reduce the complexity of the computations (and to be able to compute them), domain knowledge was used to compute approximate results.
Based on the Kevin Bacon game, we know that Kevin Bacon has been on several movies and that he is closely connected to most of the actors and actresses in the graph. Therefore, he has a high probability of being the center of the graph.

Using Kevin Bacon as the center, we compute his vertex eccentricity to get the graph radius.
A breadth-first search using Kevin Bacon as the source computes the vertices that are furthest from the center. Computing the eccentricities of these vertices we can find the diameter of the graph.

The eccentricities of the center and of the vertices furthest from it are shown in the results. The range of the eccentricities  is [10, 18]. Computing the eccentricities of all vertices would bring us back to the original problem of =~ 10^10 operations.

Finally, for the girth, we know that there is a very high probability that two actors have worked together on two different movies. This gives a girth of 4, which is the minimum girth possible for the movies graph:
Actor -- Movie -- Actor
    \            /
     \   Movie  /
To validate this theory we run the algorithm to compute the girth of the graph but stop once we find a cycle of length 4, since it is the shortest cycle possible.
