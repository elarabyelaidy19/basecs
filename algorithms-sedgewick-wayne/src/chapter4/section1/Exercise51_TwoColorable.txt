            Graph type |   Edges examined
          Random graph                172
   Random simple graph                193
 Random interval graph                  5

Conclusions:

The higher the degree of the vertices, the lower the number of edges required to be examined to discover the two-colorability of a graph using depth-first search. 
With a graph with more edges than vertices close to 10% of the graph edges have to be examined in random graphs and close to 7% of the graph edges have to be examined in random simple graphs.
With a graph with more vertices than edges close to twice the number of the graph edges (2 * E) have to be examined in random graphs and random simple graphs.
All experiments with random interval graphs (with distance of 0.3 and either 100 or 300 vertices) resulted in only 5 edges having to be examined to discover the graph's two-colorability.
