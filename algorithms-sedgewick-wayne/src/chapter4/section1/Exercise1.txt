4.1.1

The maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges is V * (V - 1) / 2.
Since we do not have self-loops or parallel edges, each vertex can connect to V - 1 other vertices. In an undirected graph vertex v connected to vertex w is the same as vertex w connected to vertex v, so we divide the result by 2.

Example:
o - o
| X |
o — o

The minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated (have degree 0) is V - 1.
Example:
o — o — o
