4.1.31 - Graph enumeration

If we were considering graphs with no self-loops:

There are (V) ways to choose a set {u, v} of two vertices. From this set there are E ways to choose the vertices to connect.
          (2)
So there are ((V)) = (V! / 2! * (V - 2)!)! / E! * ((V! / 2! * (V - 2)!) - E)!
             ((2))
             ( E )
different undirected graphs with V vertices and E edges (and no parallel edges and no self-loops).

Since we are also considering graphs with self-loops, there are (V) * 2^V ways to choose a set {u, v} of two vertices in which
                                                                (2)
vertices may or may not have a self-loop.

So there are ((V) * 2^V) = ((V! / 2! * (V - 2)!) * 2^V)! / E! * (((V! / 2! * (V - 2)!) * 2^V) - E)!
             ((2)      )
             (    E    )
different undirected graphs with V vertices and E edges (and no parallel edges).
