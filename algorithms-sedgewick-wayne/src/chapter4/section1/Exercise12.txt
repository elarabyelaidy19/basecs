4.1.12

When neither v nor w are at the root, the BFS tree tell us that if they are on the same branch, there is a path between v and w of distance equal to the number of edges between them in the branch.
If they are not on the same branch, there is a path between v and w of distance Dv + Dw, where Dv is the distance from the root to vertex v and Dw is the distance from the root to vertex w.
