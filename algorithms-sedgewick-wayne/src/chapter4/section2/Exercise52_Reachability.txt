Running 1000 experiments with 300 vertices and 100 edges for random digraphs and random simple digraphs.
Running 1000 experiments with 300 vertices and 900 edges for random sparse digraphs.

Conclusions:

According to the experiment results, when the digraph has more edges than vertices the number of vertices that are reachable from a randomly chosen vertex is higher (around 90 vertices when the digraph has 300 edges and 100 vertices) than when the digraph has more vertices than edges (around 1.5 vertices when the digraph has 100 edges and 300 vertices).
