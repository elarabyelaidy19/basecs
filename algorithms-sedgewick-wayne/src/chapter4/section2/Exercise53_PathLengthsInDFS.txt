The experiment results show that when the digraph has more edges than vertices there is a high probability of finding a path between 2 random vertices (approximately 90% when the digraph has 100 vertices and 300 edges) and the average path length of such paths is close to 1/3 vertices.
When the digraph has more vertices than edges there is a low probability of finding a path between 2 random vertices (approximately 1% for random digraphs and random simple digraphs when the digraph has 300 vertices and 100 edges). For such paths the random digraphs and random simple digraphs have an average path length close to 1/300 vertices.
