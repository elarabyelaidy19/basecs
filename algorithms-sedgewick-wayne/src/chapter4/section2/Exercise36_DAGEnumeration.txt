4.2.36 - DAG enumeration

First it is necessary to compute the maximum number of possible edges in a DAG.
Consider any vertex in the digraph. Let's call it V1.
The maximum number of directed edges that V1 can have without generating a cycle is V - 1 (it can have a directed edge pointing to all the other vertices). 
Choose a second vertex, V2. 
V2 can have a directed edge to all the other vertices, except itself and V1. This adds V - 2 additional edges to the digraph.
Continue this process for the remaining vertices: each vertex can have one less directed edge than the previous vertex.
The last vertex cannot have any directed edges.

The sum of all possible edges is (V - 1) + (V - 2) + ... + 1 + 0 = (V - 1) * V / 2

From this set of combinations there are E ways to choose the vertices to connect.

So there are ((V - 1) * V / 2) = ((V - 1) * V / 2)! / E! * (((V - 1) * V / 2) - E)! DAGs.
             (      E        )
