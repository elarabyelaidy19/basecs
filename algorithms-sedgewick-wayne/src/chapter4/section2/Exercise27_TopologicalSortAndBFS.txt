4.2.27 - Topological sort and BFS

The algorithm does not necessarily produce a topological order because some vertices closer to the source may be preceded by vertices further from the source in a topological order.

Example:
Consider the graph:
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          |             /
          v            /
          6 <----------

The algorithm running BFS would produce the following topological order: 0 1 2 6 3 4 5
Such order is invalid because 6 should be preceded by 5 in a topological order.
