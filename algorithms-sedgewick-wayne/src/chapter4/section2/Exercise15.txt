4.2.15

Let C be a strong component in a digraph G and let v be any vertex not in C.
If there is an edge e pointing from any vertex in C to v, then vertex v appears before every vertex in C in the reverse postorder of Gr.

Proof:
In Gr all the vertices in C are still reachable from one another, but now edge e points from vertex v to a vertex in C instead of pointing from a vertex in C to vertex v.
Now if v is visited before every vertex in C, then every vertex in C will be visited and finished before v finishes (because every vertex in C is reachable from v via edge e). If some vertex in C is visited before v, then all vertices in C will be visited and finished before v is visited (because v is not reachable from any vertex in C - if it were, such a path when combined with edge e would be part of a directed cycle implying that v is in C.
Consequently, the vertices in C will appear before v in the postorder of Gr. Therefore, v will appear before every vertex in C in the reverse postorder of Gr.
