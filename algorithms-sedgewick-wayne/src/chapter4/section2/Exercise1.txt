4.2.1

The maximum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices and no parallel edges is V * (V - 1).
Since we do not have self-loops or parallel edges, each vertex can connect to V - 1 other vertices. 

Example:
  o -> o
   <-
|^  XX ^|
v| <-  |v
 o -> o

The minimum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices, none of which are isolated (have degree 0) is V - 1.
Example:
o -> o -> o
