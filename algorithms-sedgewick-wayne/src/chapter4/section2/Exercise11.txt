A family of sparse digraphs whose number of directed cycles grows exponentially in the number of vertices is the following:

Take an n-cycle and make every edge a parallel edge. Now there are 2^n cycles.
Example: 

o -> o
^    |
|    v
o <- o

becomes

o -> o
^^->||
||  ||
||<-vv
o <- o

Another possibility, to avoid parallel edges, is to double each edge in a crossing way, leading to 2^(n/2) cycles.
Example: 

o -> o
^    |
|    v
o <- o

becomes

o -> o
^\  ^|
| \ /|
|  X |
| / \|
|/  vv
o <- o

The graphs are sparse, since there are just two edges per vertex in the first graph, or 1.5 edges per vertex on the second graph.
Every vertex added in this graph family will grow the number of directed cycles exponentially.
