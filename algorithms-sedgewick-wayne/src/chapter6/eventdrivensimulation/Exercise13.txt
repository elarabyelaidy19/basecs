Tests done with a random baseline temperature T, 100 * T, 10000 * T, 1000000 * T and 100000000 * T.
The standard priority queue was used to test all the temperatures.
The index priority queue was also used to test the highest temperatures: 1000000 * T and 100000000 * T.

For the standard priority queue on a lower temperature the computational bottleneck were the insert operations. However, for all higher temperatures, the computational bottleneck were the deleteMin operations.
For the index priority queue the computational bottleneck were also both the insert and deleteMin operations. In the first test the computational bottleneck were the insert operations. In the second test, with a higher temperature, the computational bottleneck were the deleteMin operations.
