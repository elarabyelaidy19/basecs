If the network forms a tree if the sink is removed this means that there are no directed cycles in the network. In other words, intermediate vertices are not directly connected: for each edge e (v->w), either v or w must be the source or the sink vertex.
A situation like this would happen:

Original network:

        s
c/f /   |c/f \ c/f
   v    v     v
   1    2      3
c/f|    |c/f   /
   v    v     /
   4    5    / c/f
c/f \   |c/f/
     v  v  v
        t

Tree formed after removing the sink vertex:

        s
 c/f/   |c/f\ c/f
   v    v    v
   1    2    3
c/f|    |c/f
   v    v
   4    5

In this case the maxflow can be computed with the following algorithm:
 For each vertex adjacent to the source:
   Do a depth first search until reaching the sink vertex. Keep track of the minimum edge capacity on the path.
 Maxflow will be equal to the sum of all the minimum edge capacities computed.
 Return maxflow.
