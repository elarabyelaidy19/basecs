6.38 - True of false

a. In any max flow, there is no directed cycle on which every edge carries positive flow.
False.
Counterexample:

    s
   | ^
2/2| |1/1
   v |
    1
    |
    |1/1
    v
    t

b. There exists a max flow for which there is no directed cycle on which every edge carries positive flow.
True.
Proof: Let f be a maximum flow and let C be a cycle on which every edge carries positive flow.
Let g = min(e E C) f(e). In other words, g is equal to the value of the minimum edge flow among the edges in cycle C.
Reducing the flow of each edge in C by g maintains the value of the max flow and sets the flow f(e) of at least one of the edges e E C to zero.

c. If all edge capacities are distinct, the max flow is unique.
False.
Counterexample:

d. If all edge capacities are increased by an additive constant, the min cut remains unchanged.
False.
Counterexample:

original network:

        s
        | 4/3
        v
        1
 1/1/   |1/1  \ 1/1    <- min cut
   v    v      v
   \    |     /
1/1 \   |1/1 / 1/1
     v  v   v
        t

After adding a constant value of 1 to all edge capacities:

        s
        | 5/3  <- min cut
        v
        1
 2/1/   |2/1  \ 2/1
   v    v      v
   \    |     /
2/1 \   |2/1 / 2/1
     v  v   v
        t

e. If all edge capacities are multiplied by a positive integer, the min cut remains unchanged.
True.
Proof: Let g be the positive integer for which every edge capacity is multiplied.
When all edge capacities are multiplied by g the value of every cut also gets multiplied by g.
Thus, the relative order of the cuts does not change and the min cut before the multiplication will remain the min cut after it.
