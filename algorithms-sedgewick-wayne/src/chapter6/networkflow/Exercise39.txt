Proposition: Each time an edge is a critical edge, the length of the augmenting path through it must increase by 2.
Proof:
Let df(vertex1, vertex2) be the augmenting path distance from vertex 1 to vertex 2.

When edge (u, v) is critical this means that:
df(s, v) = df(s, u) + 1 (since augmenting paths are shortest paths)

Before becoming a critical edge again, (u, v) must be added back by some augmenting path, which must contain it.
Let df' be the augmenting path distance when (u, v) is added back.

df'(s, u) = df'(s, v) + 1 (since edge (u, v) was removed, to add it back it is necessary to reach it from vertex v).
df'(s, v) + 1 >= df(s, v) + 1 (since df'(s, v) is in an augmenting path found after the augmenting path in which df(s, v) is, it cannot have a distance lower than df(s, v)).
df(s, v) + 1 = df(s, u) + 1 + 1 (replace df(s, v) by df(s, u) + 1, according to the above definition).

This means that df'(s, u) = df(s, u) + 2.
Therefore, the length of the augmenting path through a re-added critical edge must increase by 2.
