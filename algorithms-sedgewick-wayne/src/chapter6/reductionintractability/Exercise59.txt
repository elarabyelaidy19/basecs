Given an algorithm that solves the decision version of the vertex cover problem - which indicates that there exists a vertex cover of a given size - the optimization version of finding the vertex cover of minimum cardinality can be solved with the following method:

Consider a graph G with V vertices and E edges.

1- Using the algorithm, binary search for k, the cardinality of the minimum vertex cover.
2- Find a vertex v such that G - {v} (removing the vertex and its incident edges) has a vertex cover of size k - 1. Any vertex in any minimum vertex cover will have this property.
3- Include v in the vertex cover.
4- Recursively find a minimum vertex cover in G - {v}. The stop condition is when there is no vertex whose removal leads to a smaller vertex cover.
