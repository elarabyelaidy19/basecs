Poly-time reduction from vertex cover to 0-1 integer linear inequality satisfiability:

We consider a system of inequalities and equations that involve the following variables:
x(v) -> binary variable that is equal to 1 if vertex v is selected and 0 otherwise.

Given a graph G with a set of vertices V and a set of edges E.

Linear programming formulation:

   Minimize  E  x(v)
            veV

Subject to the constraints

   x(u) + x(v) >= 1 for every edge u - v in E
   x(v) e {0, 1} for every vertex v in V

Vertices with x(v) equal to 1 will be the vertices in the minimum vertex cover.
