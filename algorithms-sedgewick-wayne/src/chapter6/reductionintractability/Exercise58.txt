Given an algorithm that solves the decision version of boolean satisfiability - which indicates whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies a boolean expression - the assignment can be found with the following method:

Consider a boolean expression BE composed by a set of distinct variables x1, x2, ..., xn.

1- Use the algorithm to check if it is possible to satisfy BE.
If the answer is no, the expression is not satisfiable and there is no possible assignment.
If the answer is yes:
2- Assign the value true to x1 and use the algorithm to check if it is possible to satisfy BE.
3- If the answer is yes, then x1 is equal to true. Otherwise, x1 is equal to false, so update its value.
4- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all other variables.

In total, all variable assignments can be found in n + 1 runs of the algorithm, where n is number of distinct variables in BE.
