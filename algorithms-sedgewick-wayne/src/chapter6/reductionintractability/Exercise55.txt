Prove that the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path in a directed graph is NP-complete, using the NP-completeness of the Hamiltonian path problem for undirected graphs.

Let's call the Hamiltonian path problem in undirected graphs HPg and the Hamiltonian path problem in directed graphs HPdg.

Reduction from HPg to HPdg:
Replace every edge v - w in the undirected graph in HPg to two directed edges in the directed graph in HPdg:
A v -> w directed edge and a w -> v directed edge.
Solve HPdg.
The directed edges selected in the solution to HPdg can be mapped to the edges in the solution to HPg:
If either v -> w or w -> v are in HPdg solution, v - w is in HPg solution.

A problem is NP-complete if it is in NP and all problems in NP poly-time reduce to it.
HPdg is in NP because if given a Hamiltonian path as a solution, it is possible to check if all vertices are visited in polynomial time.
Since HPg is NP-complete, all problems in NP poly-time reduce to it.
As seen above, there is a poly-time reduction from HPg to HPdg. By transitive relation this shows that all problems in NP poly-time reduce to HPdg, and it is, therefore, NP-complete.
