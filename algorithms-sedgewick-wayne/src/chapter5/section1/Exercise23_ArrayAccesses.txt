5.1.23 - Array accesses

Running 10 experiments with 1000000 strings for random decimal keys (with fixed-length of 10 characters), random CA license plates, random fixed-length words (with fixed-length of 10 characters) and random variable length items (with given values 'A' and 'B'). The cutoff for small subarrays used in Most-Significant-Digit sort was equal to 15.

The experiment results show that for all random string types, 3-way string quicksort accessed the array more times than LSD and MSD sort; LSD sort accessed the array more times than MSD sort; and MSD sort had the lowest number of array accesses.
A possible explanation for these results is the fact that 3-way string quicksort accesses the array 4 times for each exchange operation, which leads to more array accesses than both LSD and MSD sorts, that do not make inplace exchanges.
LSD sort will always access the array 4 * N * W times, where N is the number of strings and W is the length of the strings (which is equivalent to 4 array accesses for each character in the keys) and MSD sort will only access the array while the strings have common prefixes, which explains why MSD sort has the lowest number of array accesses of all sort types.
