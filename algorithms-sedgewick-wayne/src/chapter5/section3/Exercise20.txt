The hashes of all k patterns should be computed and stored in a String Set.
Then, we could run Rabin-Karp algorithm and compare the hashes in the text with all k hashes.

If a match is found with any of the k hashes, return true. If all the text is checked and no matches occur with any of the k hashes, return false.
