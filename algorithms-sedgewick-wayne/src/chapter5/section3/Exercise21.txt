We could compute the hash of the pattern skipping the middle character (character at index M / 2 of the pattern, where M is the pattern length).
We would then compute the text hashes skipping the middle character as well. The rest of the algorithm would be the same.

Example:

Pattern: REXNE
Text: ABRE1NEP

We compute the hash of the characters RENE, skipping X. The result will be the pattern hash.
When computing the hash of the characters in the text we also skip the middle character:

1- Compute the hash of ABE1 and compare with the hash of RENE. The result is a mismatch.
2- Compute the hash of BR1N and compare with the hash of RENE. The result is a mismatch.
3- Compute the hash of RENE and compare with the hash of RENE. The result is a match. Return the index 2.
