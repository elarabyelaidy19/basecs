            Method | Time spent
        Bruteforce         0.01
Knuth-Morris-Pratt         0.01
       Boyer-Moore         0.00
        Rabin-Karp         0.04

The results validate the hypotheses about performance stated in the text:
Both brute force and Knuth-Morris-Pratt methods took 0.01 seconds to do the search, which is aligned with their expected performance of 1.1N operations when searching in typical texts.
Boyer-Moore took 0.00 seconds to do the search, which suggests that it did a sublinear number of operations. This is aligned with its expected performance of N / M operations when searching in typical texts.
Rabin-Karp took 0.04 seconds to do the search, a longer time than all other three methods. However, this is expected according to the hypothesis in the text that it performs 7N operations when searching in typical texts.
