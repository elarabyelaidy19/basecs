5.4.3

The maximum number of different strings that can be described by a regular expression with M or operators and no closure operators is 2^M, which happens when every position yields two choices.

Example pattern with M = 4:
(A|B)(A|B)(A|B)(A|B)

On that pattern every position has two choices, which will yield 2^4 = 16 strings:
AAAA
BAAA, ABAA, AABA, AAAB
BBAA, BABA, BAAB, ABBA, ABAB, AABB
BBBA, BBAB, BABB, ABBB
BBBB
