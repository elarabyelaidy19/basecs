5.5.21

The two longest codewords in a Huffman code have the same length.

Proof:
The longest codewords will be assigned to the symbols that have the lowest frequency of occurrence. 
If the two longest codewords have differing lengths, a bit could be removed from the end of the longest codeword while remaining a prefix code and hence have strictly lower expected length. This reduces the average codeword length and contradicts the optimality of the code.
