5.5.11

In a string whose characters are all from a two-character alphabet the Huffman code will consist of only two codes: 0 for one of the characters and 1 for the other character.
Therefore, the maximum number of bits that could be used in a Huffman code for an N-character string whose characters are all from a two-character alphabet is 1.
Example (N = 14): 

String: ababababababbb
