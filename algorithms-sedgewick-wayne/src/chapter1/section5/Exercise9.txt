This forest cannot be the result of running weighted quick-union.

Consider the tree composed of nodes 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8
Its height is 4, which is higher than lg N
lg 6 = 3 < 4

Therefore it does not hold the proposition that the depth of any node in a forest built by weighted quick-union
for N sites is at most lg N.
